# Diabetes-Demographics-in-Colorado
Visualization project of diabetes rates along Age, Income, Food Security, and Urban/Rural settings. 

# Motivation
Effectiveness in health awareness programs and education come from a greater understanding of the demographics involved. By indentifying target areas within the population, health and food resources, prevention and treatment programs can be aimed with greater precision.

We believe that the stated variables of age, income, food security, urban/rural setting have an effect on the rates of diabetes amongst the population of Colorado. 

# Goal 
By visualizing the demographics of Colorado along age, income, food security, and urban/rural settings as they pertain to diabetes rates, the aim is to identify areas within the state's population that would benefit from allocation of resources and education. 


# Data

Data Sources: USDA Food Environment Atlas Data for Colorado Census Tracts (2017), Diabetes in Adults - CDPHE Community Level Estimates (Census Tracts) (2014-2017),  Diabetes Hospitalization Rate (Census Tracts) (2013-2017), Income/Poverty (Census Tracts) (2014-2017) , Current Prevalence of Diabetes - Center for Disease Control(2011-2020), 

Using the above sources, the data will be visualized across multiple charting methods. 

# Urban vs. Rural Diabetes and Hospitalization Rates
Rural and urban Coloradans have roughly equivalent average diabetes rates (8%).  However, urban Coloradans are hospitalized for diabetes far more often than rural Coloradans (+20%).  We conjectured that distance to a hospital may account for why rural diabetics are hospitalized less often than urban diabetics.  Looking into this, we mapped hospital locations in reference to rural and urban census tracts, and differences were not significant.  

While rural Coloradans do have less access to hospitals in terms of distance, that doesn't explain why hospitalizations per 100,000 people occur at a much greater rate in urban areas.  We conjecture that people in urban areas may have less access to consistent care in terms of yearly checkups and prescription compliance and may have lower insured rates, leading to more complications and hospitalizations.  

Additionally, there is a slightly higher correlation between almost all access-impairing factors (income, distance, education) and both hospitalization per 100,000 and estimated diabetes rates (%) in urban census tracts, suggesting that the higher hospitalization rate in urban areas may be connected to a compounding of access-imparing issues.  This study could be furuther pursued by adding in census data regarding rural and urban insured rates and by looking at compounded access-imparing factors.  Insured data is available from the Small Area Health Insurance Estimates (2018) dataset from the Census Bureau.
