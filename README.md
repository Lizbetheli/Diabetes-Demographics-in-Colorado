# Diabetes-Demographics-in-Colorado
Visualization project of diabetes rates along Age, Income, Food Security, and Urban/Rural settings. 

# Motivation
Effectiveness in health awareness programs and education come from a greater understanding of the demographics involved. By indentifying these areas within the population, resources can be aimed with greater precision. 

We believe that the stated variables of age, income, food security, urban/rural setting have an effect on the rates of diabetes amongst the population of Colorado. 


# Goal 
By visualizing the demographics of Colorado along age, income, food security, and urban/rural settings as they pertain to diabetes rates, the aim is to identify areas within the state's population that would benefit from allocation of resources and education.
