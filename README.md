# Diabetes-Demographics-in-Colorado
Visualization project of diabetes rates along Age, Income, Food Security, and Urban/Rural settings. 

Effectiveness in health awareness programs and education come from a greater understanding of the demographics involved. By indentifying these areas within the population, resources can be aimed with greater precision. 



By visualizing the demographics of Colorado along age, income, food security, and urban/rural settings as they pertain to diabetes rates, the aim is to identify areas within the state's population that would benefit from allocation of resources and education. 

Data Sources: USDA Food Environment Atlas Data for Colorado Census Tracts (2017), Diabetes in Adults - CDPHE Community Level Estimates (Census Tracts) (2014-2017),  Diabetes Hospitalization Rate (Census Tracts) (2013-2017), Income/Poverty (Census Tracts) (2014-2017)

Using the above sources, the data will be visualized across multiple charting methods.
